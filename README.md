# Music Recommender Tool - Final Project at Code in Place 2021 (CS106A, Stanford University)
This is a Python program I created to submit as the final project of the special online course CS106A, Code in Place 2021, by Stanford University.

> The "Music recommender tool" randomizes songs to suggest to its users. The songs are categorized into "emotion", "genre", "occasion" and "random" playlists for users to receive song names based on their choices of these categories.

The program used the core concepts from Code in Place's course lectures such as variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, and random library.

I am very grateful for the great learning experience with the professors, section leaders, and classmates of Code in Place 2021.

I am a beginner in Python/programming learning, so the project is pretty straightforward and simple. I hope to receive your feedback on my code!
